2. GRANT OF COPYRIGHT AND PATENT LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby 
grants to the Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual 
(subject to Section 6), and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 6) 
license:

2.1. Copyright Grant

To reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and distribute the Program and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form, provided that:
    (a) Such use, reproduction, and distribution complies with all terms and 
        conditions set forth in this License;
    (b) All mandatory obligations specified in Section 3 are fulfilled.

2.2. Patent Grant

Each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Program, where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Program to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim 
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Program constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for 
that Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

================================================================================

3. MANDATORY OBLIGATIONS AND RECIPROCITY

The Licensee's exercise of the rights granted in Section 2 is EXPRESSLY 
CONDITIONAL upon the fulfillment of the following obligations:

3.1. Preservation of Notices

You must retain, in the Source Form of any Derivative Works that You 
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the 
Source Form of the Program, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of the Derivative Works. You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any 
change.

In the Object Form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, You must 
reproduce all applicable copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices 
in:
    (a) the documentation and/or other materials provided with the 
        distribution, and
    (b) a "NOTICE" text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works, 
        within the Source Form or documentation, if provided along with the 
        Derivative Works.

3.2. Explicit Attribution and Change Documentation

You SHALL provide appropriate, prominent, and conspicuous credit to the 
Licensor (KordKat Lab) and all Contributors, and You SHALL:
    (a) Include a reference to this KordKat Reciprocal Attribution License 
        (KRAL) Version 1.0, with a link to the official license text if 
        distributed electronically;
    (b) Clearly and explicitly indicate if and what changes were made to the 
        original Program, distinguishing Your modifications from the original 
        work;
    (c) Ensure that such attribution is readily visible to users of the 
        Derivative Work:
        (i)  in any documentation or README files accompanying the Derivative 
             Work;
        (ii) in the user interface or "About" section if the software provides 
             such an interface;
        (iii) in any promotional or descriptive materials related to the 
              Derivative Work.

You must not remove or alter any attribution notices, copyright statements, or 
license references present in the Program. You must not misrepresent modified 
versions as being the original Program.

3.3. Reciprocal Licensing Mandate (Copyleft Provision)

If You Distribute or otherwise make publicly available the Program or any 
Derivative Work based upon the Program, THE ENTIRE WORK MUST BE LICENSED AS A 
WHOLE under the terms of this specific KordKat Reciprocal Attribution License 
(KRAL) Version 1.0 (or, at Your option, any later version officially published 
by KordKat Lab).

This reciprocal licensing requirement means:
    (a) You may NOT apply any other license terms to the Derivative Work;
    (b) You may NOT apply any additional restrictions, whether through legal 
        terms or technological measures (including but not limited to 
        encryption, obfuscation, or digital rights management), that prevent 
        recipients from exercising the rights granted by this License;
    (c) The complete work, including all components and modifications, must be 
        made available under this License;
    (d) You must include a complete copy of this License with every 
        distribution of the Program or Derivative Works.

The reciprocal nature of this License ensures that all improvements, 
modifications, and derivative works remain freely available to the entire 
community under the same terms.

3.4. Providing Source Code

Any Distribution of the Program or Derivative Works in Object Form MUST be 
accompanied by:
    (a) A complete, corresponding machine-readable copy of the Source Code, 
        distributed under the terms of this License; OR
    (b) A written offer, valid for at least three (3) years from the date of 
        Distribution and valid for as long as You offer spare parts or customer 
        support for that product model, to provide any third party, for a 
        charge no more than Your cost of physically performing source 
        distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
        Source Code on a durable physical medium customarily used for software 
        interchange; OR
    (c) If distributed electronically, a prominent and clearly accessible 
        location (such as a publicly accessible version control repository) 
        from which the complete Source Code can be obtained at no charge.

The Source Code must include all the source files, build scripts, installation 
scripts, interface definition files, and any other materials necessary to 
generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the Object Code and to 
modify the Program.

3.5. Notice Requirements for Modified Versions

If You create a Derivative Work, You must:
    (a) Cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
        changed the files and the date of any change;
    (b) Maintain a changelog or modification log documenting the nature of 
        changes made;
    (c) Clearly identify the Derivative Work as distinct from the original 
        Program in all distributions, documentation, and user interfaces.

================================================================================

4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, THE PROGRAM IS 
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

THE LICENSOR AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, 
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
    (a) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY;
    (b) WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
    (c) WARRANTIES OF TITLE;
    (d) WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT;
    (e) WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE;
    (f) ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR 
        TIMELINESS OF THE PROGRAM.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY THE LICENSOR, ITS AGENTS, OR 
EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY 
WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN.

The Licensor does not warrant that the Program will meet Your requirements, 
that the operation of the Program will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that 
defects in the Program will be corrected.

You acknowledge that the Program is provided free of charge and that the 
absence of any warranty is an essential part of this License and a material 
inducement for the Licensor to grant the rights herein.

================================================================================

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

5.1. Exclusion of Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO 
LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT 
LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PROGRAM, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING:
    (a) DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
        CHARACTER;
    (b) LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE;
    (c) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION;
    (d) WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION;
    (e) COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;
    (f) ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES;

EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the failure of essential 
purpose of any limited remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and 
limitation may not apply to You.

5.2. Accepting Additional Liability and Indemnification

While redistributing the Program or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or 
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License 
("Additional Terms").

However, in accepting such Additional Terms, You may act ONLY on Your own 
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, NOT on behalf of the Licensor or any 
other Contributor.

You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor and each 
Contributor for any liability, claim, damage, loss, or expense (including 
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Licensor or Contributor by reason of Your accepting any such warranty or 
Additional Terms, or by reason of Your Distribution of the Program or 
Derivative Works with such Additional Terms.

5.3. Allocation of Risk

You acknowledge and agree that the disclaimers of warranty and limitations of 
liability set forth in this License form an essential basis of the bargain 
between the Licensor and You, and that the Licensor would not grant the rights 
granted herein without such limitations.

================================================================================

        destroyed or deleted, if requested by the Licensor;
